9 months later, Spash, my great project, our great project, dies and disappears due to the low activity and reputation of the server, when Spash was created I would not know it would grow so much, all thanks to ArcadiaAPI and all my friends who helped me along the way, I was sad to do this, but nothing is forever, I no longer get up to create APIs like those days, and now people just call me Skid, something that bothers me, because I realized that I am nobody more than a Skid, people hate me, nobody uses Spash, so what is the use of maintaining a community that will never come back, maybe it was my fault, or someone else's, but I know I will come back, another thing Spash is not spelled SPLASH and it is Spash from Spanish in case it was not obvious, if you want to support me with donations or something in the new project I would appreciate it, I Diego250x say goodbye for now.
